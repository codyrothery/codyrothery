Hi, I'm Cody and I'm new here ðŸ˜„ 

After 25 years working in a wide array of positions and industries, I'm transitioning into tech!

Of the many hats I have worn, I've been a:

 - dishwasher
 - line cook
 - sandwich artist
 - barista
 - English teacher
 - executive assistant
 - project coordinator

I'm currently building my dev foundations in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I'm not stopping there. I also enjoy art and animation on the web and am starting to learn more about these topics and am slowly developing my digital art skills.
